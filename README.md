# Tazu (Your Social Search Engine

Tazu (å°‹) in japanese means inquire, to look for. 
The purpose of our work is to not lose the information we have the desire to acquire.


Do you have a lot of bookmarks accumulated? This might be the website you've been looking for.

This website allows you to create your own personalized search engine, where you can share with your friends and see what they have been curious about.

We also created a mascot, a cat, because of the amount of curiosity we share with this animal.
