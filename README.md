# Tazu (Your Social Search Engine)

Tazu (å°‹) in japanese means inquire, to look for. 
The purpose of our work is to not lose the information we have the desire to acquire.


Do you have a lot of bookmarks accumulated? This might be the website you've been looking for.

This website allows you to create your own personalized search engine, where you can share your bookmarks with your friends and see what they have been curious about.
With easy access and creative layout we hope to incentivate you to use it and find a new organized home for your favorite websites.

We also created a mascot, a cat because of the amount of curiosity we share with this animal.
